/**
 * This package contains repository classes responsible for data access and persistence.
 * Repository classes encapsulate database operations and provide an interface for interacting with
 * the underlying data store.
 * They typically include methods for querying, saving, updating, and deleting entities.
 * Repository classes may use technologies such as Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, or custom SQL
 * queries to interact with the database.
