/**
 * This package contains DTO (Data Transfer Object) classes used for transferring data between
 * different layers of the application.
 * <p>
 * DTO classes are typically lightweight objects that carry data between the client and the server,
 * or between different layers of the server.
 * These classes are often used to encapsulate data retrieved from the database or received from
 * external sources, and are not directly tied to the database schema.
