/**
 * This package contains mapper classes responsible for mapping between different data transfer
 * objects (DTOs) and entity classes.
 * <p>
 * Mapper classes facilitate the conversion of data between DTOs used for transferring data between
 * layers and entity classes used for persistence.
 * These classes help maintain separation of concerns and ensure clean architecture by encapsulating
 * the mapping logic.
